# Flowers Image Classifier
Final project for the Udacity Nanodegree program: AI programming with Python 

Image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. The classifier works with a dataset of 102 flower categories.

The code is organized in two parts:
1.- A trainer file that preprocesses the images and trains the image classifier on your dataset
2.- A predictor file that is able to predicts image content (provided that its class is one of the categories the classifier has been trained in)
